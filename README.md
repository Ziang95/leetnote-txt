# Leetcode Note in .txt 
This is a simple *keyword highlighter* for those who want to take leetcde study note in txt format  
**For simplicity!** :fist:
## How does it work?
### Keywords:
* `Easy`
* `Medium`
* `Hard`
* `url`
* `Tips`
* `*`
  
Keywords `Easy`~`Hard` stand for the level of problems that you note, for best color effect, use `Dark+` theme of vscode, which will make `Easy` into **Grean**, `Medium` into **Blue**, `Hard` into **Red**

Each time opening your txt notebook, you might want to use `ctrl+k ctrl+0(num 0)` to fold all the regions so that every entry will be shown in perfect lines. then you can choose any one to inspect and visit the related site.

And you may use `*` to indicate how important this problem is for you to review.  
`Tips` may be used to show the region of hints, follow ups, approaches or what you've learnt.

***
## Patterns
All the bracket pairs like `(), [],{},<>`are supported. And:   
* `< >` is dedicated for url indicator and will make string inside into quote style. By pressing `ctrl` and clicking on the url you can visit the problem site.
* `[ ]`is dedicated for Problem title indicator, string inside will be shown as **markup bold** style

#### Enjoy~ :heart:
